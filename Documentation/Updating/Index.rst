If you are updating the CKEditor Pack for TYPO3 to a newer version, please review this section
carefully to ensure a smooth and safe upgrade.

Versioning
-----------

The CKEditor Pack follows the semantic versioning model.

It uses the format:  

``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``

- **Major:** Includes breaking changes  
- **Minor:** Introduces new functionality without breaking existing setups  
- **Patch:** Contains bug fixes and minor improvements without breaking changes  


Before Updating
----------------

Always back up your database and files before performing an update to avoid any data loss or compatibility issues.

Before proceeding with any update:

Review the changelog of all versions released since your current installation. This helps you understand new features, deprecations, or potential adjustments. You can find the full changelog in the documentation.

Run the update on a test or staging environment, if possible. This allows you to identify any conflicts or required configuration updates safely. Always create a full database and file backup before updating the extension. This ensures you can roll back quickly in case of unexpected issues.
