Contribution
============

Contributions play an important role in the growth and quality of open-source projects.  
They are not limited to writing code, improving documentation, reporting issues, or helping 
others on community channels are equally valuable.

Contribution Workflow
---------------------

1. **Create an Issue First**  

   Before starting any change, please open an issue in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/T3Planet/rte_ckeditor_pack/issues>`_   
   This helps clarify the problem, discuss feasibility, and confirm whether the proposed 
   change will be accepted.

2. **Bug Fixes**  

   If you are addressing a bug, clearly describe the issue and provide steps to reproduce it.  
   Bug fixes can only be reviewed and accepted if the problem can be reproduced reliably.

3. **New Features**  

   Not all features are suitable for every user.  
   To keep the extension simple and maintainable, please discuss new features in an issue 
   before submitting a pull request.  
   This ensures alignment, avoids unnecessary complexity, and helps evaluate whether the 
   feature should be included.

4. **Pull Requests**  

   All pull requests should be created from the latest release branch to avoid conflicts and 
   ensure compatibility.
