Editoria11y – Live Accessibility Checker in CKEditor
===================================================

The Editoria11y Live Accessibility Checker is integrated directly into CKEditor to help editors create accessible content while they are editing.

It automatically checks content for common accessibility issues, such as heading structure, alternative text for images, link text, and basic contrast-related problems. Issues are highlighted directly inside the editor, so editors can fix them before publishing.

The checker can be used in real time while typing or manually through a toolbar button. This makes accessibility checks easy and does not require leaving the TYPO3 backend or using external tools.

By using Editoria11y in CKEditor, editors can improve content accessibility early and better follow WCAG guidelines and European accessibility requirements.
